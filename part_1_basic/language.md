# Topics should be covered
## 1. C++ Basic Input/Output
## 2. Data Types
At the core of any programming language lies the concept of data types a way for the language to understand what kind of value a variable can hold. Data types define not only the nature of the data but also the operations you can perform on it and the amount of memory it will consume. If you think of a variable as a box, then the data type is the label on that box telling the computer whatâ€™s inside and how to handle it.

## 3. If-Else Statements 
Conditional statements are a key part of programming. They let your code make decisions by checking if certain conditions are true or false. Depending on the result, different parts of the code can run, allowing your program to respond dynamically to different situations.
