# Topics should be covered
## 1. C++ Basic Input/Output
## 2. Data Types
At the core of any programming language lies the concept of data types a way for the language to understand what kind of value a variable can hold. Data types define not only the nature of the data but also the operations you can perform on it and the amount of memory it will consume. If you think of a variable as a box, then the data type is the label on that box telling the computer what’s inside and how to handle it.

## 3. If-Else Statements 
Conditional statements are a key part of programming. They let your code make decisions by checking if certain conditions are true or false. Depending on the result, different parts of the code can run, allowing your program to respond dynamically to different situations.
## 4. Switch Case Statements
## 5. What are arrays, strings?
## Arrays

An array is a linear data structure used to store and operate on data. You can access any element randomly using its index.

In other words, an array is a collection of similar types of elements (homogeneous) stored in contiguous memory locations—one after another.

Arrays store related information in adjacent memory blocks.

### Summary of Arrays

- **Memory is allocated instantly**  
  After the array is created, memory is allocated immediately. The array remains empty until values are assigned.

- **Elements are located in a contiguous manner**  
  This allows efficient access (direct access, O(1) = constant time) using index values.

- **Arrays are powerful data structures**  
  The type of elements and the size of the array are fixed at creation. Arrays store elements of the same type.

- **Inserting elements**  
  Insertions at the end of the array take constant time O(1). Inserting at the start or middle is possible but more complex.

- **Removing elements**  
  Reach the index and remove the element. This operation also takes constant time O(1).

## Strings

Strings are like a series of characters stored in a specific order. Each character in a string is assigned an index, starting from 0.  
This means the first character is at index 0, the second character at index 1, and so on.

### Problem
- **Finding the Length of a String?**

- **Accessing Individual Characters?**

- **Passing, Returning, and Assigning Strings?**

- **String Comparison?**
